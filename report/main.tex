\subsection{Purpose}
In this assignment, basic simulation techniques has been used to analyze and evaluate the performance of a factory. The factory consists of a machining center and inspection station in series. Unfinished parts arrive at the factory with exponential interarrival times with a mean of 1 minute. Processing times at the machining center are uniform on the interval [0.65, 0.70] minute, and subsequent inspection times are uniformly distributed as [0.75, 0.80] minute. Ten percent of the parts are bad and are sent back to the machine for rework (i.e. 90% of the
inspected parts are good and are sent to shipping).

The machining center is subject to randomly occurring breakdowns. In particular, a new (or a
freshly-repaired) machine will break down after an exponential amount of time with a mean of 6 hours. Repair times are uniform on the interval [8, 12] minutes. If a part is being processed when the machine breaks down, then the machine continues where it left off upon the completion of repair. The factory is initially empty and idle, and is working continuously without any breaks periods.

                        \item Knee Point:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Throughput: 25 Mbps
                                \item Data Rate: 30 MBytes/sec
                            \end{itemize}
                        \item Maximum Throughput: 37 Mbps
                        \item Compared to TCP (76.3 Mbps), it was expected that UDP acheives heigher throughput than TCP. However, due to the default packet size (1470 Bytes / datagram). By increasing the data packet size, the throughput for UDP was improved. Note however that differing nature of UDP and TCP flows means that it their measurements should not be directly compared. Iperf sends UDP datagrams are a constant steady rate, whereas TPC tends to send packet trains. This means that TCP is likely to suffer from congestion effects at a lower data rate than UDP. (\url{http://kb.pert.geant.net/PERTKB/IperfTool})
                        \item The error rate remains within the expected bound (Less than 1 percent). For the error rate below the knee point (30 MBytes/sec), the error increases with the increase in data rate. After the knee point, the error rate behavior tend to be unpredicted but remains heigher than 0.4 percent.
                        \item By changing the direct cable used to connect the two computer devices in the LAN, the UDP and TCP throughput was changed depending on the wire used. Higher quality wires achevied better results reaching up to 90.5 Mbps for TCP and 65 Mbps for UDP.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Performance of UDP connection is better than TCP connection. Although the data collected for the LAN network showed that TCP is faster than UDP, this is not the expected case. This could be due to the packet size assigned for the datagrams and several other different factors.
                    \item \[ Bandwidth_{LAN} > Bandwidth_{WLAN} > Bandwidth_{ADSL} > Bandwidth_{Dail up}\]
                    \item The packet loss ratio increases when the data rate increases.
		  \item It was quite difficult to measure the performance of UDP network over dial-up connection. This is due to the high loss ratio and failure to receive the final server report for the received datagram and loss rate.
