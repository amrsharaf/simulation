The metric used: Hourly Throughput
Stopping creteria: confidental interval is 1% from the mean

testing stopping creteria:
-------------------------
1 - alpha = 0.005
Average = 60.080000
Standard Diviation = 0.571859
CI = [ 60.07891 , 60.08109 ]

since CI satisfies our creteria , such that 100 hour simulation is enough for satisfying
